		Here are a few coffee shops that I’ve grown fond of during my years in Ithaca.

			<h1>Stella’s</h1>

		<p>Stella’s is one of those places that does everything damn well, and then some. Not only is the coffee quality exquisite, Stella’s boasts one of the most carefully-named drink menus I’ve ever had the pleasure of coming across. The menu is organized in categories that include The Classics, The Lost Generation, Cavalier Poets, Stream of Consciousness, Gothic Drama, Hypertextual, Transcendentalists, The Beat Poets, and more. The drink names also don’t disappoint. There’s quirky, poetic names like the “New Hampshire Communist Latte” and “Willows in the Wind”. Logophiles rejoice!</p>
		<p>Come for the warm atmosphere, the ample table workspace, the rotating selection of local art, and the full restaurant menu that’s available from the cafe side. Yes, the dark mahogany walls, mellow lighting, and pleasant ambience may be so calming that you become a tad drowsy. But fret not. The coffee will keep you awake. </p>

		<p>It’s hard to imagine Ithaca without Gimme! Coffee. Gimme! has consistently been voted the best coffee in New York State, and for good reason. This coffee shop does the classics right. If excellence were a liquid, it would be the coffee served here. The coffee is full and bold and velvety and so, so good in latte or espresso form or anything in between.</p>
		<p>Gimme! is too good to just be in one location. And thank goodness for that. The ambience in Gimme!’s locations is as rich and distinct as the coffee. Gimme!’s interiors in both locations boast bold, minimalistic furnishings, a rotating selection of local art, and an interesting workspace. The windows and sidewalk benches at the Cayuga Street location are perfect for people watching. The State Street location is mellow and expansive and has an array large wooden communal tables. Gimme! is always abuzz with activity, but the atmosphere is just the right balance between lively conversation and the quiet hum of people trying to be productive.</p>
		<p>It seems that wherever I am, Gimme! is always waiting around the corner like an old friend. And it’s a lovely thing.

			<h1>The Shop</h1>
			<h5><a class="address" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Shop/@42.440676,-76.495018,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89d0819b39542169:0x40ce4e5a907fb9ce">

		<p>I’m infinitely fond of The Shop. The space is bright and charming. There’s pastel accents, interesting patterns on the ceilings, colorful tiling, cheery yellow walls and never a shortage of little details to notice. To add to the unapologetic quirkiness of this place, there’s even a tattoo parlor tucked away at the end of the space. The Gimme! coffee that’s served is delicious. There are fairy lights and plants and ample outlets. There’s a varied selection of baked goods and breads. The menu features delightful typography from next-door neighbor Standard Art and Supply. There’s really not much more that you need in a coffee shop.</p>
		<p>Come here on a bright Sunday afternoon and bask in the sunlight that floods through the windows and look at the hanging plants casting intricate shadows on the walls. Or sit outside on the pastel chairs in the front of the brick building as dusk falls and watch TCAT buses sleepily drive by. Slowly sip on your latte and think of how thankful you are that this gem of a coffee shop exists.
